ABDM  has five digitisation programs: Ayushman Bharat Health Account1) Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA); 2) ABHA mobile App; 3) Health Facility Registry (HFR); 4) Health Care Professional Registry; and 5) Unified Health Interface (UHI). I ask given the federal democratic structure in India, the poor spending in the public health sector and the huge burden of out-of-pocket expenditure by the individuals, can ABDM be a game-changer in restructuring the health sector in India? Can ABDM meet the expectation of improving health care delivery, the health-sector decision-making at the macro-level, as well as provide patients with access to safe longitudinal medical records that can be shared across health providers in the public and private sectors? Finally, can it help achieve 'health for all', leaving no one behind?In my talk I critiqued the techno-deterministic perspective and offered a provocation  - With the digitisation of everything becoming rampant, what does this mean for digital inclusion, and how can exclusion be addressed?Digital Health can also exacerbate existing health disparities or introduce new barriers for socially disadvantaged groups. The ABDM has the potential to improve accessibility and equity in the long run, however, several implementation challenges need to be addressed urgently to enable this to be a game-changer in the digital health ecosystem to facilitate accessibility and equity. Implementation challenges include adoption, limited infrastructure, technological barriers, digital illiteracy and skills gaps, privacy and data protection concerns, financial and regulatory burdens etc etc. To conclude: We have a long way to go.Dr. Pushkarni PanchamukhiProfessor Dwarika UniyalRV UniversitySchool of Economics and Public Policy RVU\n"
