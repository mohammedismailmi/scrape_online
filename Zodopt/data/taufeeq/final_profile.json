            "profile_text_data": "\nFeatured\nArticle\nWhy India Isn't Ready for EdTech\nTaufeeq Riyaz on LinkedIn\nI remember sitting in my class during lunch break in my 11th grade, watching a group of my classmates hunched over their phones. Their screens flashed with complex equations and mock test results. Curious, I struck up a conversation with one of them, a 17 year old (Let's name him Chintu) preparing for the IIT-JEE. He told me about the countless hours he spent on an EdTech app that promised him a top rank. Yet, when I asked him if he enjoyed what he was studying or if he understood the concepts deeply, he hesitated. \"It's not about enjoyment,\" he said. \"It's about getting that rank.\" The Dream Sellers of Education Here’s a snapshot of the homepage of one of India’s leading EdTech startups. What do you see? For me, it’s not just a pitch for courses, it’s a promise of dreams. But here’s the thing, are we selling education, or are we selling the fear of falling behind? India's education landscape has always been competitive, but the rise of EdTech has turned it into a marketplace of dreams. Coaching institutes once held the monopoly on promising top exam ranks and prestigious college admissions. Now, EdTech companies have taken over, leveraging technology to amplify these promises. They sell not just courses but aspirations, cracking the IIT-JEE, acing the NEET, or landing a high-paying job after a short program. These platforms are masterful at tapping into the fears and hopes of students and parents alike. The fear of being left behind. The hope of a secure future. In a society where academic achievement is often equated with self worth, it's a powerful strategy. But here’s the uncomfortable truth - it’s rarely about actual learning. Forget critical thinking or creativity, what sells is rote memorization, test hacks, and shortcut culture. Real-world skills? Who’s got time for that when rankings are on the line? At Tenacity, we’ve seen this struggle up close. We’ve tried to flip the narrative, focused on personalized learning, practical skills, and creating a love for knowledge. Sounds good on paper, right? But then you hear questions like, “How quickly can I get a job?” or “Will this help me rank higher?” And you realize how deeply ingrained this outcome driven mindset is. It’s not entirely EdTech’s fault. In India, education equals results. Parents don’t see it as nurturing intellect, they see it as securing a future. And honestly? That’s valid. But it’s a short-term play that sidelines the stuff that really matters - problem-solving, adaptability, creativity. It ignores the development of problem-solving abilities, adaptability, and the soft skills that are crucial in today's rapidly changing world. Let's go back to the 17 year old Chintu I told about earlier. Despite using multiple EdTech platforms, he confessed that he often felt overwhelmed and unfulfilled. \"I can solve complex problems, but sometimes I don't understand why I'm doing it,\" he admitted. \"I worry that once the exams are over, I won't know what's next.\" His uncertainty highlights a significant issue. When education is reduced to a means to an end, students may achieve short term goals but are ill prepared for long term success and fulfillment. The Reality Check Most EdTech companies, in their race to the top, have forgotten the essence of education. By selling dreams and quick fixes, they're not just shortchanging students like Chintu but also contributing to a workforce that lacks critical competencies. Moreover, this model isn't sustainable. As more students and parents recognize the gap between promises and reality, trust in these platforms diminishes. It's a cycle that ultimately hinders progress in the education sector. India's readiness for a true EdTech revolution is hampered by cultural expectations and systemic issues. Until there's a collective shift in how we perceive education, i.e. valuing learning over ranking, the cycle will continue. I had a wake up call recently after meeting Harnidh Kaur (Head of WTFund) at a GenShe event. She didn’t sugarcoat it - students in India aren’t ready for real EdTech yet. There’s a cultural reset needed, one that values learning over rankings, skills over shortcuts. Until then, the cycle continues. And here’s where Tenacity comes in. We’re making some hard decisions, suspending two products to focus entirely on our learning platform. It’ll stay free, open source, not-for-profit, and community-driven. Why? Because we believe education isn’t about selling dreams, it’s about building futures that last. There’s a fine line between being optimistic and being straight-up delusional, especially when you’re building something in the chaotic world of entrepreneurship. In India’s EdTech scene, that line? It’s blurry. Real blurry. A lot of founders have these big, dreamy visions of “revolutionizing education.” Sounds awesome, right? But here’s the thing, dreams don’t pay the bills or solve real-world problems unless they’re grounded in reality. Ignoring market challenges and practical constraints? That’s where optimism slips into delusion. It’s not about thinking small, it’s about building smart. The market is unforgiving, but if you get it right, the impact you can make is massive. Cheers!

ABDM  has five digitisation programs: Ayushman Bharat Health Account1) Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA); 2) ABHA mobile App; 3) Health Facility Registry (HFR); 4) Health Care Professional Registry; and 5) Unified Health Interface (UHI). I ask given the federal democratic structure in India, the poor spending in the public health sector and the huge burden of out-of-pocket expenditure by the individuals, can ABDM be a game-changer in restructuring the health sector in India? Can ABDM meet the expectation of improving health care delivery, the health-sector decision-making at the macro-level, as well as provide patients with access to safe longitudinal medical records that can be shared across health providers in the public and private sectors? Finally, can it help achieve 'health for all', leaving no one behind?In my talk I critiqued the techno-deterministic perspective and offered a provocation  - With the digitisation of everything becoming rampant, what does this mean for digital inclusion, and how can exclusion be addressed?Digital Health can also exacerbate existing health disparities or introduce new barriers for socially disadvantaged groups. The ABDM has the potential to improve accessibility and equity in the long run, however, several implementation challenges need to be addressed urgently to enable this to be a game-changer in the digital health ecosystem to facilitate accessibility and equity. Implementation challenges include adoption, limited infrastructure, technological barriers, digital illiteracy and skills gaps, privacy and data protection concerns, financial and regulatory burdens etc etc. To conclude: We have a long way to go.Dr. Pushkarni PanchamukhiProfessor Dwarika UniyalRV UniversitySchool of Economics and Public Policy RVU\n"
